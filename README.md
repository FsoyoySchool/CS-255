# CS 255 Portfolio Submission - DriverPass Project
**Summary**  
The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a company that helps students prepare for their driving exams. The client, DriverPass, needed a system that could allow students to buy practice packages, schedule driving sessions with instructors, take practice exams online, and track their progress toward passing their driving tests.

**What did you do particularly well?**  
I believe I did well in organizing the system requirements clearly and creating detailed UML diagrams that matched the client's needs. I made sure the diagrams were clean, labeled correctly and easy to follow.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
If I could revise one part of my work, I would spend more time polishing the UML class diagram. I would add a few more relationships between objects and double check attribute details to make it even more realistic and complete.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
I carefully read the DriverPass interview transcript and business requirements to understand what the students, instructors, admins and the system itself needed to do. I made sure my diagrams showed how users interact with the system. It’s important to consider user needs in design because if the system doesn’t work for the user then it won’t be successful no matter how good the code is.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**  
When designing software, I like to break things down into smaller pieces. I start with the users and their goals, then map out how the system should behave step-by-step. In the future, I will continue using diagrams like use case, activity, and class diagrams early in the process. They help me stay organized and make sure I’m building the right thing before I even start coding.
